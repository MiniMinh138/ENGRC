      <h1>Capital One Virtual Card</h1>
      <img>
      <p>This project was a part of my internship, so, visually, there is not much I can display. The gist of the
        project was to unify the styling of 3 different webpages on the Capital One banking website. The 3 pages were
        the virtual card interface for 3 different merchants that provide the same functionality. Despite the similarity
        in functionality, the 3 webpages had many inconsisencies and different design choices due to them being create
        by different teams.</p>
      <p>The first part of the project was to recreate the 3 pages from scratch to have a better understanding of the
        components and how they were initially built. I worked on a team of 6 interns and we split into pairs to each do
        a webpage.</p>
      <p>That took about 2 weeks as we learned how to work together and use github as a team. The actual work was not
        very difficult as we were mainly working with css.</p>
      <p>After that, we reconvened and decided on whose css styling to adopt/how to combine our 3 webpages. Then we
        worked together to standarized across our webpages. The work was a lot more git involved due to all 6 of us
        working at the same time. This really taught me how to collaborate on git and manage different conflict issues.
      </p>
      <p>The final part of the internship was creating our presentation. This was pretty straightforward, but its the
        first time I presented to people that had higher stakes in the project/real professionals, so we spent a good
        about of time practicing and pitching our project.</p>
