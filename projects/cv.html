      <h1>DIFT</h1>
      <p>The goal of this research project is to determine if DIffusion FeaTures (DIFT) can be used to extract
        functional correspondences between objects in an image. </p>
      <p>DIFT is a new methodology of extracting semantic correspondence between a pair of images using implicit
        knowledge from diffusion networks that are trained on similar images. Semantic correspondence is a visual
        correspondence between different objects of the same category. For example, the eyes of two different dogs or
        the camera lens of two different phones. Functional correspondence is a visual correspondence between, possibly,
        two objects of different categories, but can be used for the same task or purpose. An example of this is the
        handle on a pan and the handle on a basket or the opening of a shoe and the opening of a water bottle (if the
        task is pouring something).</p>
      <img src="../assets/ref_features.png">
      <p>My task in this research project is to complete a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of DIFT aiding in
        finding functional correspondences.</p>
      <p>DIFT uses the Stable Diffusion model to extract correspondences between pairs (or more) of images. The Stable
        Diffusion model, in short, is a model that is used to generate images using a prompt. The model does this by
        adding and removing noise to the image. DIFT makes use of these intermediate noisy images to extract the
        correspondences between images.</p>
      <p>My main task is to use a dataset of known functional correspondences between images and test if DIFT can find
        those correspondences given the task as the prompt. If DIFT could complete this with no additional support, then
        the project is complete. The relaxed goal of this preliminary research is to see if a change in the prompt helps
        or changes the correspondences found in the images.</p>
      <p>The first task was to reformat the images and the known correspondences (keypoints) to be used in DIFT. The
        main issue was that the images were all of different sizes and that the correspondences were not given in x,y
        coordinate form, but percentages across the axes.</p>
      <p>After formatting the images, we ran a quick test on a pair of images to see how the correspondences compared to
        the true points. We found that with and without the prompt of the task, the correspondences were generally
        incorrect. That being said, the prompt did change the location of the correspondences.</p>
      <img src="../assets/green.png">
      <p>To better gauge how DIFT is performing, we use a metric to determine if DIFT found a correct correspondence,
        and then we run DIFT on the entire dataset, once with no prompt and once with the task prompt. The metric we use
        is if the found correspondence is within 23 pixels of the true correspondence, then it is a hit, otherwise it is
        a miss.</p>
      <p>There is currently a computational barrier to running this test on my local computer, so this task is being
        postponed until access to the server is allowed.</p>
