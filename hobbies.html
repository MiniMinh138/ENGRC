              <h2>Skiing</h2>
              <p>I started skiing in the winter of 2022 and I've been going on annual trips since then. I really enjoy
                the thrill of going down the slope. It requires a lot of coordination and balance which I enjoy
                training. The trips are usually with my closest friends and we spend a whole week just enjoying each
                others' company.</p>

              <h2>Dancing</h2>
              <p>I started dancing in 2022 when I joined my college dance team, the Assorted Aces. The dance team's
                motto is "anyone can dance." Before college, I had little to no dance experience and the assorted aces
                really allowed me to grow and develop this passion. Dance, and art in general, is only half complete
                until it is shared, and the Assorted Aces allowed me to share my passion each year with our annual
                showcases and other smaller performances.</p>
              <p>Post college, I hope to continue this passion by joining a dance studio. Even if I don't join one, I
                hope to share my dance experience and growth via social media and connect with the vast network of
                Assorted Aces alums.</p>

              <h2>Art</h2>
              <p>Art is something that I've always been interested in but too scared to try. I started delving more into
                artistic things (painting, drawing, photography) after my senior of high school. In my off time, I enjoy
                building these skills and trying new mediums. I hope to keep up some type of art account to continue
                this passion. I want to try book binding and more graphic design in my down time the upcoming year.</p>
