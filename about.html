      <img src="assets/headshot.png" alt="headshot" width="50%">
      <p>Hi! I’m Minh and I’m currently studying at Cornell University as an undergraduate. I’m majoring in Computer
        Science and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I finish my undergraduate degree in Fall 2024, but
        I also plan to complete a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science by Spring 2024. My main interests in CS are
        software engineering and computer vision. Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing and other forms of art!</p>

              <h2>Early Life</h2>
              <p>I grew up in Maryland and have been there for most of my life. I went to Elanor Roosevelt high school
                which had a Science and Technology program that allowed me to develop my interests and skills in
                engineering.</p>
              <p>At Roosevelt, I took many hands on introductory engineering classes. Some of the projects I worked on
                was building a building out of balsa wood, creating a pin hole camera, and making a website.</p>
              <p>I also took my first Computer Science class in high school, but it didn't foster much of an interest
                due to the poor teaching style of the teacher.</p>

              <h2>HS Internship</h2>
              <p>One of the main draws of the Science and Technology program at Roosevelt was the senior year research
                project. For the research project, Roosevelt helped match us with internships in the area. I matched
                with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab and worked with Dr. Edward Gaddy. My project was to do data
                analysis on the Parker Solar Probe.</p>
              <p>This project was the one that sparked my interest in Computer Science. A lot of the work was
                computational and graphical, but this was the first time I experienced the workflow of coding. I had to
                learn to import data, clean it up, and modify it with different mathematical formulas.
              </p>
              <p>The research project component of the work taught me how to read and interpret research papers. It is
                one of the main reasons that I'm interested in research now in College.</p>

              <h2>Cornell University</h2>
              <p>I'm currently a Senior at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science. Cornell has been a very
                important part of developing my career and interest in CS. A lot of the classes have taught me how to be
                a cleaner coder, but most of my experience here has come from project teams and research.</p>
              <p>I worked with Cornell Mars Rover on their electrical subteam for a year where I built a servo control
                board from scratch and developed the code frame to interface and control the servos. This experience
                really helped bridge hardware and software for me and gave me an appreciation for both.</p>
              <p>I've spent a year researching in the Computer Vision lab where I worked more in data analysis and
                pipelining. This has definitely helped develop my coding style.</p>
              <p>I plan to spend another year completing an MEng in CS where I hope to delve further into robotics and
                computer vision.</p>

              <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
              <p>My first internship was at Capital One where I worked on a front-end team. This experience was
                definitely different from my previous work. It was a glimpse into the real world and how teams work
                together on a unified code base. The experience of working on a team at Capital One has definitely
                shaped my perception of how working will be.</p>
              <p>Apart from the experience working on a team, this was also my first experience working in front-end and
                it has shown me that I do enjoy software development as well. This gives me more flexibility in the jobs
                that I can do post-grad.</p>
